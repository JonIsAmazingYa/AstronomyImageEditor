# Astronomy Image Compositor
This software is designed for use with astronomical images obtained through robotic telescopes. It allows the creation of full-colour images by combining images taken with RGB filters, and the reduction of noise from other images obtained from astronomical telescopes.

It was developed in 2016 as part of my time studying abroad at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
